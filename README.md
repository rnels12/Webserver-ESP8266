# Webserver-ESP8266

This is a simple source code to create a simple webserver using ESP8266. The code can be compiled and deployed using Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or VScode (with an arduino extension). Note that the code needs a library called ESP8266WiFi.h, which can be installed via the Library manager of Arduino IDE, and your wifi ssid and password, which should be put in a file called "WIFIID.h".

Have fun!
